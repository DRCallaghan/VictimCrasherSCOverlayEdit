  ## Description:
  - I built this project to provide a more thorough overlay for osu! streamers which still takes up very little space on a stream overlay. To this end, I added star rating, BPM, different mod icons, and max pp on the existing overlay that came with StreamCompanion.
  - This should be a one-stop shop for anyone looking for an extensive but compact overlay.
  - I remembered a bunch of programming knowledge I had forgotten due to lack of practice while making this.
  - This overlay has all usual info not displayed on screen displayed right on the overlay!

  ## Installation:
  To install this overlay, download [StreamCompanion}(https://github.com/Piotrekol/StreamCompanion/releases/tag/v230327.15) by clicking on the Setup.exe file. Then, after installing, put this folder into StreamCompanion\Files\Web\overlays\static\conv. From there, simply use [this link](http://localhost:20727/overlays/static/conv/VictimCrasherCompactDioEdit/) as a browser source in OBS.

  ## Usage:
  Once properly installed, the pp counter should look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/sWg5LbE.png).
  You can also change the mod icons as you see fit within this folder. Note that the old v2 icon was left in due to my skin not having a v2 mod icon.

  ## Outside Resources
  This overlay would not work at all without [StreamCompanion](https://github.com/Piotrekol/StreamCompanion).
